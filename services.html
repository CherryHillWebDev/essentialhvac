                            What is a Ductless System?
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            In case you don’t know, a ductless or mini split air conditioning system is a lot like a central air conditioner system. Most mini splits also prodide heat. They both consist of two units: a condenser that sits outside the home, and an evaporator/air handler that sits inside the home. Refrigerant passes between the two units, carrying the heat from indoors to the outdoor unit where it is released.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a central air system, however, the cool air is blown through the air handler or furnace into the your ductwork, where it is carried into the rest of the house. A ductless system uses slim line-set and cable between the condenser and a unit on your wall, and no ductwork is involved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are some questions we ask our customers to help them decide which type is the best match for their home and needs.
                        </p>

                                Do You Have Existing Ductwork?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                This is the main decision maker for most people. If you have ductwork in your home already, it will be more cost effective to stay with a central system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have no ductwork, a ductless system should be considered. There will also be much less construction mess: all you need is a 3-inch hole in the wall to run the line-set and cable through. Ductless systems are also great for homes with new additions that aren’t connected to the ductwork that runs through the rest of the house.
                            </p>    
                        </div>

                                Will You Mind Looking at Your Air Conditioner?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                When you’re indoors, a central AC is invisible. A ductless system, however, requires a slim unit on the wall or along the floor. Other types can also mount in the ceiling. While the manufacturers go to a lot of trouble to make the boxes as stylish as possible, there is still something to see.

                            <p>
                                Generally speaking, ductless systems are very quiet. If noise levels matter to you, be sure to ask your technician for the noise level (in decibels) for any systems you’re considering.

                                How Important is Energy Efficiency to You?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Now this is a bit of a loaded question, because with central air the quality of the ductwork and the installation job play a huge role in helping a central system reach its efficiency potential.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, if the ductwork wasn’t designed well (more twists and turns than needed) or if it isn’t sealed properly and air is leaking, the efficiency of a central system drops. In terms of installation quality, the technician has to do things like ensure the right level of refrigerant, system equipment matches, proper blower settings, etc.
                            </p>  
                            <p>
                                All that being said, many ductless systems have a higher potential energy efficiency (currently up to 42 SEER) than the best central systems.

                            <p>
                                Do you have some areas of your home that get much warmer or cooler than others or different family members like different temperatures? With ductless systems, each zone has its own independed temperture control.

                                Most ductless systems aren’t just an air conditioner, they are what’s called a ‘heat pump’. That means when it gets cold outside, many can provide heat when temperatures are -5 degrees outside.

                        The two most common systems used to heat homes are either a natural gas furnace or a standard heat pump. Most people have an idea of how a furnace works but many don't understand how a heat pump works. To over simplify a heat pump; a heat pump is an air conditioner that can essentially work backwards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the summer time, the heat pump causes the indoor evaporator coil to get cold while the outdoor condenser coil section gets hot. In heat mode, a heat pump reverses the process so the indoor coil section gets hot and the outdoor coil gets cold. Standard heat pumps are very efficient in producing heat down to an outdoor temperture of about 40 degrees. At that point the efficiency really starts to fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some heating systems utilize both a furnace and a heat pump. We commonly call this setup a dual fuel system. A dual fuel system will consist of a furnace and a heat pump utilizing one or the other depending upon the outdoor ambient temperature and heat demand being called. A dual fuel system can be very efficient.

                                Generally, even a good deal can cost you a good bit of money. However, if your home requires cooling, a furnace will need to be matched with an air conditioner. A heat pump can do both. All together, your home comfort costs may be less with a heat pump. Of course, unit costs will vary depending on the size and model selected for both.

                                Gas furnaces can have a range of efficiencies ranging from 80% to 98% "Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency". Standard heat pumps also have a range of efficiencies and operate very well until the outdoor ambient temperture drops below 40 degrees. At that point the ability of a standard heat pump to provide heat in an efficient manor starts to plumette. Infact as the outdoor ambient temperture drops, the heat pump will loose its ability to provide adequate heat and will usually cause an auxilary electric heat source to kick in which can get expensive to operate.

                                Since heat pumps don’t use combustion, they don’t produce any harmful greenhouse gas emissions. This is becoming more and more important and some communities are even instituting local regulations insisting on lower-emission heat sources. Recent advancements have made many furnace models more energy efficient and lower their impact on the environment.

                                The heat produced by gas furnaces feels warmer compared to heat pump. In general, the air from a heat pump isn’t as warm as what you get from a gas furnace. It’s still warming your home, but it “blows at a lower temperature.” Some people don’t like that. In contrast to the hot and dry air of a furnace, heat pumps circulate air that’s naturally humid – so they may not cause your home to feel as dry as a furnace.

                                A gas furnace generally has a longer lifespan than a heat pump. Furnaces with proper maintenance can last 20 years or more. A heat pump, like an air conditioner, more commonly has a lifespan of about 15 years. Since a gas furnace is only used for a few months out of each year, the maintenance requirements are less than those for a heat pump. A gas fired furnace also has fewer mechanical parts than a heat pump, meaning fewer things that can break down or malfunction.

                        Air conditioner and furnace maintenance can be easily overlooked, but it should be a priority for every homeowner. In fact, equipment manufacturers recommend maintenance yearly in order to keep air conditioners and furnaces running smoothly and efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best time to schedule air conditioner maintenance is in the spring, before you need to use your cooling system and just before the fall for your furnace; this way, your system is tuned up and prepared for summer and winter, and you can address any equipment issues in advance instead of suffering without cooling when temperatures rise or heating when temeratures drop.

                        Whether it's a high tech communicating comfort system or a basic comfort system, we do that. And we do it well. Choosing a reliable installer is so important. If your new heating or cooling system isn’t installed correctly, it won’t operate at its expected efficiency level, costing you more money. Faulty installation can also place more stress on the system, leading to frequent repairs and early system failure.

                    <p>
                        Many systems fail prematurely due to improper installation. You can buy any system, but if the blower settings, gas pressures, static air pressures, high and low voltage wiring, fuse sizes, a precision refrigerant charge, airflow, water drainage, gas piping, intake air, exhaust system, thermostats and other items aren’t set up correctly, you’ll find your new system not lasting nearly as long as it could have. It can be the difference of your system lasting 10 years or lasting 20 years.
